## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring the relationship between crime and football in New Orleans by examining crime rates during the football season. I hypothesize that as the New Orleans Saints win, the crime rate for that week is lower than the crime rate for the weeks that they lose games. I will explore this data by collecting data on Saints wins from a given year(or a couple of years) as the independent variable and data on the number of crimes called in in a given week that the Saints played.
